Hi, I’m Scott Blake, the voice behind _MacAdmin Musings_. :wave:

I am a Senior Client Platform Engineer with a passion for automating and optimizing Apple management workflows. With years of experience in deploying and managing fleets of Apple devices, I’ve become obsessed with turning repetitive tasks into robust, repeatable, and documented workflows. I know firsthand what it's like to juggle daily operations, package deployments, and identity workflows. I’m not writing from theory—I’m writing from the trenches, where each day brings a new pipeline to build, a new script to tweak, and countless ways to automate repetitive tasks.

This space is dedicated to you, the busy MacAdmin looking for practical insights that save time and reduce stress. Here, you'll find real-world examples and tested patterns for AutoPkg packaging and automations, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) with Terraform, and Okta-based identity flows—all aimed at making your Apple ecosystem more reliable, scalable, and manageable. This blog is a space to share those hard-earned wins—and the lessons learned along the way. I believe that sharing what works (and what doesn’t) benefits us all, and I’m excited to learn from your stories as well.
