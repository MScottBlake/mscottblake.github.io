Hello and welcome to MacAdmin Musings, a blog dedicated to the thoughts, tools, and techniques of a MacAdmin navigating todayâ€™s IT landscape.

Whether you're deep into MDM workflows, building serverless infrastructure, or automating device provisioning with code, you're in the right place.

If you are:

- A MacAdmin trying to scale your automation
- A DevOps-minded engineer crossing into Apple fleet management
- An IT pro wrangling identity and compliance
- Someone who prefers managing systems with reproducible, well-documented code

...then this blog is for you and I hope you find it useful.
