I'm thrilled to announce that the video from my recent presentation at the [MacAdmins Conference 2025](https://macadmins.psu.edu/) hosted by Penn State is now available online! It was an absolute pleasure to share the stage and discuss the evolution of AutoPkg and introduce a new tool to the community. I consider MacAdmins Conference to be the best in the business, so I am always happy to be a part of the magic.

## The Presentation: "Celebrating AutoPkg with a new Runner"

My talk, titled "**Celebrating AutoPkg with a new Runner**," delved into the history and importance of AutoPkg and relevent tools in the ecosystem over the past 15 years. These tools are foundational to what we do as IT professionals and have become industry standards in a lot of ways.

I also introduced a new runner designed to simplify and modernize AutoPkg workflows. [Cloud AutoPkg Runner](https://pypi.org/project/cloud-autopkg-runner/) was built from the ground up to better support CI/CD pipelines with easy installation and efficient processing of recipes with intelligent caching and concurrent recipe runs. I have much to say about this project, but I'll save that for another post.

## A Heartfelt Thank You

As always, a huge thank you goes out to the entire MacAdmins Conference team for organizing an exceptional event once again. Their unwavering commitment to supporting and educating the MacAdmin community is truly inspiring. The conference provides a truly invaluable platform for sharing knowledge and networking.

Thank you to everyone who attended my session, participated in the discussions, and asked insightful questions. I was mentally unprepared for the amount excitement and praise I received all week.
